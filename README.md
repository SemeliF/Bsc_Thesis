MATLAB and R code used for my research "A qEEG Analysis in the Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease".

To better understand my methodology, the first file that should be opened is "thesis_EEG_analysis.m".
This code pre-processes the EEG data, calculates the Power Spectral Density (PSD) and the Phase-Locking Values (PLV).

Next, please open the file "spectral_analysis.R". This code performs the statistical tests used for the spectral analysis (i.e. Method 1).

Lastly, the file "connectivity_analysis.R" contains the statistical code for the functional connectivity analysis (i.e. Method 2).
